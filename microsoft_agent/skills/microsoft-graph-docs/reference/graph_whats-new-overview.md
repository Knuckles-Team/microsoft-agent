### Files
Updated the admin consent requirement for the following delegated permissions related to SharePoint Embedded file storage container management:
  * The `FileStorageContainerType.Manage.All` delegated permission no longer requires admin consent.
  * The `FileStorageContainerTypeReg.Manage.All` delegated permission no longer requires admin consent.


[](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/whats-new-overview?context=graph%2Fapi%2F1.0&view=graph-rest-1.0#groups)
### Groups
  * Added the **resourceBehaviorOptions** and **resourceProvisioningOptions** properties to the [group](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/group) resource. These properties enable you to specify group behaviors and associated resources for a Microsoft 365 group.
  * Added a known issue: For soft deleted security groups, the **securityEnabled** property returns `false` instead of `true`. To identify the group type, use the **groupTypes** property where `["Unified"]` indicates a Microsoft 365 group and an empty array (`[]`) indicates a security group. For more information, see [Get deleted item](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/directory-deleteditems-get) and [List deleted items](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/directory-deleteditems-list).

### Identity and access | Identity and sign-in
  * QR code authentication method in Microsoft Entra ID lets you manage the QR code authentication method for users, and how they can sign in with a QR code and PIN. The following key resources support this capability:
    * The [qrCodePinAuthenticationMethod](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/qrcodepinauthenticationmethod) resource and related APIs for managing QR code PIN authentication methods for users. This single-factor authentication method is designed for frontline workers and combines a QR code with a PIN. The following related resources were also added: [qrCode](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/qrcode), [qrPin](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/qrpin), and [qrCodeImageDetails](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/qrcodeimagedetails).
    * The [qrCodePinAuthenticationMethodConfiguration](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/qrcodepinauthenticationmethodconfiguration) resource for managing the QR code authentication method policy for a tenant.
    * Updated the [authenticationMethodModes](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/authenticationmethodmodes) and [baseAuthenticationMethod](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/baseauthenticationmethod) enumerations to add the `qrCodePin` member to support this new authentication method.

  * Added the **principal** and **principalCollection** data types to the [externalConnection](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/externalconnectors-principal) to specify the data type for people‑related property items in the external connection.
  * Added the **description** property to the [externalConnection properties](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/externalconnectors-property) to allow the addition of a description to the schema properties in the external connection.
  * Added more tags or semantic labels that can be added to **labels** in the [externalConnection property](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/externalconnectors-property) in the external connection schema. Labels help Microsoft 365 Copilot understand the semantics of the data in the connection and provide more relevant results.
  * Added the **contentCategory** property to the [externalConnection](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/externalconnectors-externalconnection) to specify the domain category of the content associated with the external connection for improved relevance and ranking.

Use the **requiredResourceAccess** property on [agentIdentityBlueprint](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/agentidentityblueprint?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) to specify the Microsoft Graph permissions (delegated scopes and app roles) required by the agent.

### Backup storage
Users can now browse a `fastRestore` endpoint and selectively restore files and folders by creating a browse session.
The granular restore process is designed to be simple and efficient and consists of three main steps:
  * **Create a browse session**
Initiate a browse session for a specific restore point (backup snapshot).
    * You can create a [SharePoint browse session](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/backuprestoreroot-post-sharepointbrowsesessions?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) or a [OneDrive for Business browse session](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/backuprestoreroot-post-onedriveforbusinessrestoresessions?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true).
  * **Browse items**
Once the session is created, the user can query it to list all backed-up items available within the browse session.
    * Results are returned as a collection of [browseQueryResponseItem](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/browsequeryresponseitem?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) objects, each representing a file, folder, or other resource.
    * You can browse items within a [SharePoint browse session](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/sharepointbrowsesession-browse?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) or a [OneDrive for Business browse session](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/onedriveforbusinessbrowsesession-browse?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true).
  * **Create a restore session**
Select one or more items from the browse session and initiates a restore session.
    * Only the selected items are restored to their previous state, leaving the rest of the site or drive unchanged.
