# Microsoft Graph REST API beta endpoint reference
Feedback
Summarize this article for me
##  In this article
  1. [Call the beta endpoint](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/overview?view=graph-rest-beta#call-the-beta-endpoint)
  2. [Microsoft Graph v1.0 endpoint](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/overview?view=graph-rest-beta#microsoft-graph-v10-endpoint)
  3. [What's new](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/overview?view=graph-rest-beta#whats-new)
  4. [Related content](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/overview?view=graph-rest-beta#related-content)


The reference content in this section documents the Microsoft Graph REST APIs in the `beta` endpoint. The beta endpoint includes APIs that are currently in preview and aren't yet generally available. We invite you to try these APIs and provide your feedback.
The APIs in the beta endpoint are subject to change. We don't recommend that you use them in your production apps.
[](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/overview?view=graph-rest-beta#call-the-beta-endpoint)
## Call the beta endpoint
Microsoft Graph API requests to the beta endpoint use the following pattern:
HTTP
Copy
```
https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/{resource}?[query_parameters]

```

For more information about Microsoft Graph REST API calls, see [Use the Microsoft Graph API](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/use-the-api).
[](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/overview?view=graph-rest-beta#microsoft-graph-v10-endpoint)
## Microsoft Graph v1.0 endpoint
Currently, two versions of Microsoft Graph REST APIs are available: v1.0 and beta.
If you're interested in using APIs that are generally available, see [Microsoft Graph v1.0 endpoint reference](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/overview?view=graph-rest-1.0&preserve-view=true).
To determine whether a beta API is available in v1.0, use the version selector in the left navigation. If the API is available in v1.0, you can switch to the v1.0 reference article.
For more information, see [Versioning and support](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/versioning-and-support).
