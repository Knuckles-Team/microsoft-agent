Namespace: microsoft.graph
Create a new [group](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/group?view=graph-rest-1.0) as specified in the request body. You can create the following types of groups:
  * Microsoft 365 group (unified group)
  * Security group


This operation returns by default only a subset of the properties for each group. These default properties are noted in the [Properties](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/group?view=graph-rest-1.0#properties) section.
To get properties that are _not_ returned by default, do a [GET operation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/group-get?view=graph-rest-1.0) and specify the properties in a `$select` OData query option.
> **Note** : Although Microsoft Teams is built on Microsoft 365 groups, you can't currently create a team via this API. You can use the other group APIs to manage a team that has been created in the Microsoft Teams UI.
This API is available in the following [national cloud deployments](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/deployments).

## Permissions
Choose the permission or permissions marked as least privileged for this API. Use a higher privileged permission or permissions [only if your app requires it](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-overview#best-practices-for-using-microsoft-graph-permissions). For details about delegated and application permissions, see [Permission types](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-overview#permission-types). To learn more about these permissions, see the [permissions reference](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-reference).
Expand table
Permission type | Least privileged permissions | Higher privileged permissions
---|---|---
Delegated (work or school account) | Group.ReadWrite.All | Directory.ReadWrite.All
Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Not supported. | Not supported.
Application | Group.Create | Directory.ReadWrite.All, Group.ReadWrite.All
For an app, create a group with owners or members while it has the _Group.Create_ permission, the app must have the privileges to read the object type that it wants to assign as the group owner or member. Therefore:
  * The app can assign itself as the group's owner or member.
  * To create the group with users as owners or members, the app must have at least the _User.Read.All_ permission.
  * To create the group with other service principals as owners or members, the app must have at least the _Application.Read.All_ permission.
  * To create the group with either users or service principals as owners or members, the app must have at least the _Directory.Read.All_ permission.

## Request body
In the request body, supply a JSON representation of the [group](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/group?view=graph-rest-1.0) object.
The following table lists the properties that are required when you create the [group](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/group?view=graph-rest-1.0). Specify other writable properties as necessary for your group.
Expand table
Property | Type | Description
---|---|---
displayName | String | The name to display in the address book for the group. Maximum length: 256 characters. Required.
mailEnabled | Boolean | Set to `true` for mail-enabled groups. Required.
mailNickname | String | The mail alias for the group, unique for Microsoft 365 groups in the organization. Maximum length is 64 characters. This property can contain only characters in the [ASCII character set 0 - 127](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/office/vba/language/reference/user-interface-help/character-set-0127) except the following characters: ` @ () \ [] " ; : <> , SPACE`. Required.
securityEnabled | Boolean | Set to `true` for security-enabled groups, including Microsoft 365 groups. Required. **Note:** Groups created using the Microsoft Entra admin center or the Azure portal always have **securityEnabled** initially set to `true`.
  * Creating a group using the **Group.Create** application permission without specifying owners creates the group anonymously and the group isn't modifiable. Add owners to the group while creating it so the owners can manage the group.
  * Creating a Microsoft 365 group in an app-only context and without specifying owners creates the group anonymously. Doing so can result in the associated SharePoint Online site not being created automatically until further manual action is taken.
  * Creating a Microsoft 365 or security group in a delegated context, signed in as a non-admin user, and without specifying owners automatically adds the calling user as the group owner. An admin user is automatically added as the group owner of a Microsoft 365 group they create but not of a security group.
  * A non-admin user can't add themselves to the group owners collection. For more information, see the related [known issue](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/known-issues/?search=26419).
  * The following properties can't be set in the initial POST request and must be set in a subsequent PATCH request: **allowExternalSenders** , **autoSubscribeNewMembers** , **hideFromAddressLists** , **hideFromOutlookClients** , **isSubscribedByMail** , **unseenCount**.

## Response
If successful, this method returns a `201 Created` response code and a [group](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/group?view=graph-rest-1.0) object in the response body. The response includes only the default properties of the group.

The following example creates a Microsoft 365 group. Because the owners aren't specified, the calling user is automatically added as the owner of the group.

### Example 2: Create a group with owners and members
The following example creates a Security group with an owner and members specified. A maximum of 20 relationships, such as owners and members, can be added as part of group creation. You can subsequently add more members by using the [add member](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/group-post-members?view=graph-rest-1.0) API or JSON batching.
A non-admin user can't add themselves to the group owners collection. For more information, see the related [known issue](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/known-issues/?search=26419).
